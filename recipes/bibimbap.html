    <p>
        Bibimbap, sometimes romanized as <b>bi bim bap</b> or <b>bi bim bop</b>, is a Korean rice dish.
        The term <em>bibim</em> means "mixing" and bap is cooked rice. It is served as a bowl of warm white 
        rice topped with namul (sautéed or blanched seasoned vegetables) and gochujjang (chili pepper paste). Egg and sliced meat (usually beef) are common additions, stirred together thoroughly just before eating.

        The exact origin of bibimbap (비빔밥) is unknown. People could have started mixing bap (rice) with banchan (side dishes) after the outdoor jesa (rites), such as sansinje (rite for mountain gods) or dongsinje (rite for village gods), 
        where they needed to "eat with the god" but did not have as many cooking pots and items of crockery to hand as they would normally have at home. Jeonju Bibimbap is an old-fashioned dish.[7] Some scholars assert that bibimbap 
        originates from the traditional practice of mixing all the food offerings made at an jesa (ancestral rite) in a bowl before partaking of it.
